1- What are the collections?
-Recipes collection
-Categories collection

2- What information will you embed in a document and which will you store normalised?
 Embedded Information:
 _id, name, steps, ingredients,

 Normalized Information:
 categories

3- What made you decide when to embed information? What assumptions did you make?
I decided to separate categories from the recipes because I thought that it would be easier to search for recipes based on categories.
I also thought that it would be easier to update categories if they were separated from the recipes.

4- If you were given MySQL and MongoDB as choices to build the recipe's database at the beginning, which one would you choose and why?
 I would like to use mongoDB because it is more flexible and scalable. It is also easier to use and faster to process data.
